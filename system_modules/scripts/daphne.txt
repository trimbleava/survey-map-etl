# Deploying Django Channels with Daphne & Systemd
# Gunicorn/Apache is what we can use to run the WSGI application - which is our django app. 
# To run the ASGI application we need something else, an additional tool. 
# **[Daphne](https://github.com/django/daphne)** was built for Django channels and is the simplest. 
# We can start daphne using a systemd service when the server boots, just like we start gunicorn 
# and then gunicorn starts the django app.

sudo apt install daphne
Navigate to `/etc/systemd/system/`

Create `daphne.service`. Notice the port is `8001`. This is what we need to use for our `WebSocket` connections in the templates.
